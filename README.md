# readme-creator

## what was the goal of this project?
- The goal of this project was to take user responses and create a proper README file with them. I achived this by including the required packages to run this app. I then created a series of prompts to collect all of the user responses. These reponses are then plugged into the proper README format. Which then is used to write to the file and create the README.
